### 🇩🇰 About RettSync
**RettSync is a Danish software consultancy re-engineering the business-software relationship.**

We reject the "Rent-Seeker" SaaS model. Instead, we architect **proprietary digital ecosystems** that are legally and technically owned by the client from Day 1. Our solutions combine the robustness of enterprise ERPs with the agility of modern consumer apps.
